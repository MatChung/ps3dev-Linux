Have you always wanted to be able to make ps3 homebrew but couldn't compile the toolchain?

Well now you can. With my pre-compiled ooPo ps3toolchain for Ubuntu Server 10.10.
PLEASE DON'T MIRROR!!!!! IF YOU WANT TO MIRROR IT FORK IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just place it in any of these places
	/home/{User}/ps3dev/
	/usr/local/ps3dev/
	/home/{User}/Desktop/ps3dev/

Any of those places will be fine.

Then open your .bashrc and at the very bottom place this text it will vary for the place you put the toolchain. (but I will put all three of the place you could have put it.) ONLY USE ONE.

	If you put it in /usr/local/ps3dev/ you will need to put this into your .bashrc

		## Setup ps3toolchain environment
		export PS3DEV=/usr/local/ps3dev
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/bin
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/host/ppu/bin
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/host/spu/bin
		## Setup PSL1GHT Environment
		export PSL1GHT=$PS3DEV/psl1ght
		export PATH=$PATH:$PSL1GHT/host/bin

 
if you put it in /home/{User}/ps3dev/ you will need to put this into your .bashrc]

		## Setup ps3toolchain environment
		export PS3DEV=/home/{User}/ps3dev
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/bin
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/host/ppu/bin
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/host/spu/bin
		## Setup PSL1GHT Environment
		export PSL1GHT=$PS3DEV/psl1ght
		export PATH=$PATH:$PSL1GHT/host/bin


	If you put it in /home/{User}/Desktop/ps3dev/ you will need to put this into your .bashrc

		## Setup ps3toolchain environment
		export PS3DEV=/home/{User}/Desktop/ps3dev
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/bin
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/host/ppu/bin
		export PATH=$PATH:$PS3DEV/host/spu/bin
		## Setup PSL1GHT Environment
		export PSL1GHT=$PS3DEV/psl1ght
		export PATH=$PATH:$PSL1GHT/host/bin


Thats it! Now you have the ooPo ps3toolchain installed.
If you still do not understand what to do you are hopeless until I create a script that can do all of this for you.



PS....
	This is a Beta Release of the compiled toolchain. There are no viruses and i think no bugs. if there are any bugs please message me on github or psgroove. if you want to build it yourself the script it located at htts://github.com/ooPo/ps3toolchain.


I put this at the very bottom of this post so that you read all of it before cloning or forking the repo.
1) To get the pre-compiled toolchain on linux make sure you have git installed.
2) Open terminal and cd to one of the three directories above
3) type "git clone https://github.com/Goblom/ooPo-ps3toolchain-linux.git" without the quotes
4) it may take a while because it is 540mb.
